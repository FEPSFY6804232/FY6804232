      Sonar, otherwise know as Sound Navigation and Ranging systems, have a variety of uses in the world of engineering and science. Whether it is used for navigation, deep sea exploration, scientific research or submarine warfare, the information it can provide us is crucial for advancing our understanding of the ocean. This article looks briefly into the history of Sonar and its fundamentals.

      Sonar was first discovered using similar principles to its predecessor radar. This is due to radar using radio waves which are very similar to the sound waves used in Sonar. Radar was first patented in Germany 1904 by Christian Hülsmeyer (German Patent Office, 1904) and has been technically improved continuously for the last 120 years. The rapid development of automotive radars being able to recognize different objects and assign risk of collision (Stateczny, Kazimierski, Kulpa, 2021) is just one example of these advancements. Sonar was then made known in 1914 by Fessenden in the US. Following the tragic events of the titanic, studies were being carried out to find an iceberg detection system. Fessenden could detect an iceberg from 2 nautical miles with the help of a dynamic loudspeaker (Marage, Mori, 2010).

      Sonar is fundamentally different to radar and electro-optical systems. With energy being transferred to the receiver through mechanical vibrations (Hodges, 2010), sonar cannot be used in a vacuum. However, a sound wave is also the only physical medium that can be propagated over long distances in water. This means that sonar is perfect for use in sub-aquatic environments as other forms of energy emission quickly dissipate as heat (Li, 2012).

       The fundamentals behind sonar are based on the propagation of sound waves between a target and a receiver. There are four different types of sonar, the main two being passive and active, with ambient and daylight sonar being a little more uncommon.  Using a passive sonar system, energy originates at a target and propagates to the receiver, analogous to passive infrared detection (Hodges, 2010). An active sonar system uses wave propagation from the transmitter to measure waves reflected by a target back to a receiver, analogous to pulse-echo radar (Hodges, 2010). And for both daylight and ambient sonar, the environment is the source of the sound which bounces off/is blocked by the target; The effects of which can be observed by the receiver. This type of sonar is analogous to human sight (Hodges, 2010).

      ‘Targets’ and ‘Clutter’ are key terms when it comes to both radar and sonar. ‘Targets’ are a term used to describe objects of interest, whilst ‘Clutter’ is a term used to describe unwanted reflections detected by sonar; An example of a ‘Target’ would be a submarine, whilst a rock formation would be considered ‘clutter’. Radar/sonar designers have been working for decades to try and filter out clutter returns as much as possible. Initially it was primarily used as a sensor to detect and track targets, as only limited information could be extracted from the reflected radar/sonar signal (Tait, 2006). A ‘blip’ or ‘plot’ was conventionally used to represent a reflection from the target, which lacked resolution on target features (Tait, 2006).

      A definition of Sonar is: ‘the method or equipment which detects the existence of, locates the position of, and identifies an underwater object using underwater acoustic waves. In a broad sense, any system that uses underwater acoustic energy to observe or to communicate is called a sonar system’ (Li, 2012, p.27).
